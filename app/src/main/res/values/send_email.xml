A sign in attempt requires further verification because we did not recognize your device. To complete the sign in, enter the verification code on the unrecognized device.</string>

If you did not attempt to sign in to your account, your password may be compromised. Create a new, strong password your Firebase account.</string>
    <string name="message_email_5">

If you\'d like to automatically verify devices in the future, consider enabling two-factor authentication on your account.</string>
    <string name="message_email_6">

If you decide to enable two-factor authentication, ensure you retain access to one or more account recovery methods.</string>
